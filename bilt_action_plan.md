Here are proposed action plans—grounded in the BILT‐plus process described by Beheler & Dempsey—for each category:

---

### 1. Recruiting Employers

| **Action Items**                                                                                                                                                          | **Who’s Involved**                                 | **Success / Impact Metrics**                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. **Identify and segment target employers**<br/>– Compile lists of C‑suite “thought leaders” and frontline SMEs in key IT clusters (e.g., data analytics, cloud).        |  Faculty lead; Career Services; Industry Liaison   | – Number of employers identified vs. invitations sent<br/>– Diversity of employer types (size, sector)                      |
| 2. **Develop invitation materials**<br/>– Create “pro forma” KSAT draft to preview the meeting format, plus an overview of commitment/time expectations.                  |  Faculty; Instructional Designer; Marketing Office | – Open rate for email invites<br/>– Positive RSVP rate                                                                      |
| 3. **Outreach & follow‑up campaign**<br/>– Email, phone, LinkedIn touch‑points; leverage alumni and board members for warm introductions; schedule brief discovery calls. |  Faculty; Dean/Administrator; Alumni Relations     | – # of meaningful conversations held<br/>– # of RSVPs secured (target ≥ 10 employers per cluster)                           |
| 4. **Onboard and orient**<br/>– Send pre‑meeting materials (agendas, KSAT primer); host a 30‑min “what to expect” webinar for new participants.                           |  Faculty; Program Coordinator                      | – % of confirmed employers who attend the orientation webinar<br/>– Pre‑meeting survey confidence (target ≥ 80% “prepared”) |

> *Rationale:*
> Recruiting is the first BILT step—“putting employers in a co‑leadership role” begins by engaging both thought leaders and SMEs in structured cohorts ([Micro Nano Technology Education Center][1]).

### 2. Hosting the BILT Meeting

| **Action Items**                                                                                                                                                            | **Who’s Involved**                              | **Success / Impact Metrics**                                                                                              |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. **Finalize logistics & agenda**<br/>– Book rooms/Zoom links; distribute a pro‑forma KSAT list for initial voting; plan 2–3 hours per cluster.                            |  Faculty; Administrator; IT Support             | – On‑time distribution of materials<br/>– Smooth tech execution (≤ 5% glitches)                                           |
| 2. **Facilitate KSAT voting**<br/>– Use electronic voting (1–4 scale) to prioritize KSATs; allow 20–25 min for voting per item, then group discussion.                      |  Trained Facilitator; Employer SMEs; Note‑taker | – % of employers completing votes (goal ≥ 90%)<br/>– # of KSAT edits suggested during discussion                          |
| 3. **Capture and synthesize results**<br/>– Aggregate voting data; record discussion highlights; draft updated KSAT roster and initial KPI drafts.                          |  Facilitator; Faculty Lead; Data Analyst        | – Timely delivery of synthesis (< 7 days post‑meeting)<br/>– Accuracy verified by 2 independent reviewers                 |
| 4. **Post‑meeting verification**<br/>– Convene SMEs in a short follow‑up (virtual) to validate KPIs, employability skills (ES), and draft student learning outcomes (SLOs). |  Faculty; Employer SMEs; Curriculum Committee   | – Verification meeting attendance rate (≥ 75%)<br/>– % of KPIs & ES items ratified without major revisions (target ≥ 80%) |

> *Rationale:*
> Regular, well‑structured BILT meetings (ideally quarterly) and a clear voting process are key to maintaining employer engagement and generating “future‑facing” skill standards ([Micro Nano Technology Education Center][1]).

### 3. Aligning Curriculum

| **Action Items**                                                                                                                               | **Who’s Involved**                                        | **Success / Impact Metrics**                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. **Map KSATs & KPIs to existing courses**<br/>– Cross‑reference prioritized KSATs/KPIs with syllabi; flag gaps and redundancies.             |  Curriculum Committee; Department Chair; Faculty          | – % of KSATs covered by ≥ 1 course (target ≥ 90%)                                            |
| 2. **Revise SLOs & assessments**<br/>– Update course SLOs to reflect KSAT language; design or adjust assignments to measure KPIs.              |  Faculty; Instructional Designer                          | – # of courses with revised SLOs<br/>– Assessment alignment index (e.g., rubric match ≥ 85%) |
| 3. **Pilot updated modules**<br/>– Run one section with new curriculum; collect student performance data on targeted KPIs and ES.              |  Faculty; Assessment Coordinator; Student Representatives | – Improvement in KPI‑aligned assignment scores vs. baseline (target ≥ 10% increase)          |
| 4. **Close the feedback loop with employers**<br/>– Share pilot results at next BILT meeting; solicit recommendations for further refinements. |  Faculty; Employer SMEs                                   | – Employer satisfaction survey (target ≥ 90% “curriculum meets needs”)                       |

> *Rationale:*
> Embedding employer‑verified KSATs and KPIs into SLOs and course assessments ensures graduates possess the in‑demand skills 12–36 months ahead—one of the core outcomes of the ITSS “BILT‑plus” approach ([Micro Nano Technology Education Center][1]).

By executing these action plans—recruiting thoughtfully, hosting efficient BILT meetings, and systematically aligning curriculum—you’ll institutionalize a repeatable, employer‑led process that keeps your programs tightly synced with workforce needs.
