| **BILT Model**                                  | The Business and Industry Leadership Team model—“the engine” of the ITSS process—provides a structured, repeatable method for engaging employers nationwide to ensure curriculum aligns with workforce needs ([Micro Nano Technology Education Center][1]). |
| **BILT‑plus**                                   | An enhanced approach combining the core BILT Model’s verified KSATs with supplemental resource products (KPIs, ES, and SLOs) to deliver a more comprehensive skill‑standards package ([Micro Nano Technology Education Center][1]).                         |
| **Delphi surveys**                              | Follow‑up rounds of questionnaires conducted among thought leaders to gain consensus on the most critical IT job clusters after initial meetings ([Micro Nano Technology Education Center][1]).                                                             |
| **Employability Skills (ES)**                   | Often called “soft skills,” these are non‑technical competencies (e.g., communication, teamwork) ranked by employer SMEs to support the technical “hard” skills in the KSATs ([Micro Nano Technology Education Center][1]).                                 |
| **Job Cluster SMEs**                            | Subject matter experts (first‑line hiring managers, experienced technicians, etc.) who collaborate in cluster‑specific meetings to prioritize and verify KSAT items ([Micro Nano Technology Education Center][1]).                                          |
| **Job clusters**                                | Broad IT categories identified by thought leaders (e.g., data analytics, software development) representing the most critical areas of workforce need ([Micro Nano Technology Education Center][1]).                                                        |
| **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**           | Statements that specify “how good is good enough” for each highly‑prioritized KSAT, later validated in separate verification meetings ([Micro Nano Technology Education Center][1]).                                                                        |
| **KSATs** (Knowledge, Skills, Abilities, Tasks) | Core skill‑standard elements identified and ranked by employers; each KSAT describes what a well‑qualified entry‑level worker should know or be able to do 12–36 months into the future ([Micro Nano Technology Education Center][1]).                      |
| **Pro‑forma KSAT list**                         | The draft list of KSAT items provided to employers before voting, serving as the starting point for the electronic ranking and discussion process ([Micro Nano Technology Education Center][1]).                                                            |
| **Student Learning Outcomes (SLOs)**            | Competency statements crafted by educators—aligned to the verified KSATs—to guide course and assessment design, ensuring graduates demonstrate the prioritized knowledge and skills ([Micro Nano Technology Education Center][1]).                          |
| **Thought leaders**                             | C‑suite executives (CTOs, CIOs, futurists) convened to innovate and define the six most critical IT job clusters based on present and future workforce needs ([Micro Nano Technology Education Center][1]).                                                 |
| **Verification meetings**                       | Follow‑up sessions where employer SMEs vote on and discuss KPIs (and ES) using the same electronic‑voting format applied to KSATs, to finalize performance thresholds ([Micro Nano Technology Education Center][1]).                                        |
